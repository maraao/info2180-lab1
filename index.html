 <h2>Ojiugo Okoroafor</h2>
 <p>Hi! My name is Ojiugo and some very basic information about myself is that my favourite colour is blue, I love to travel and I'm a third year student. I chose Web Development because I have and interest in creating and designing websites and wanted to learn more about it, as well as how to successfully do it from scratch. I am also considering a career in Web Development so this would give me an idea of what to expect.</p>
